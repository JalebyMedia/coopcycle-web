CoopCycle
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coopcycle/coopcycle-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/coopcycle/coopcycle-web)

CoopCycle is a **self-hosted** platform to order meals in your neighborhood and get them delivered by bike couriers. The only difference with proprietary platforms as Deliveroo or UberEats is that this software is [reserved to co-ops](#license).

The main idea is to **decentralize** this kind of service and to allow couriers to **own the platform** they are working for.
In each city, couriers are encouraged to organize into co-ops, and to run their very own version of the software.

The software is under active development. If you would like to contribute we will be happy to hear from you! All instructions are [in the Contribute file](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Coopcycle-web is the main repo, containing the web API, the front-end for the website and the dispatch algorithm : [Â Technical Overview ](https://github.com/coopcycle/coopcycle-web/wiki/Technical-Overview). You can see it in action & test it here : https://demo.coopcycle.org

You can find a comprehensive list of our repos here : [ Our repos comprehensive list ](https://github.com/coopcycle/coopcycle-web/wiki/Our-repos-comprehensive-list).

How to run a local instance
--------------

### Prerequisites

* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).

    - On OSX : use [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) which will provide you both `docker` and `docker-compose`. It doesn't rely on Virtualbox as Docker used to.

    - On Windows : use [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows) which will provide you both `docker` and `docker-compose`. It doesn't rely on Virtualbox as Docker used to.

    - On Linux : follow [the instructions for your distribution](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). `docker-compose` binary is to be installed independently. You can use CoopCycle without root privileges, to do so run `sudo usermod -aG docker your-user` (will add you to the `docker` group).

* Setup Google Maps API

CoopCycle uses the Google Maps API for Geocoding, as well as the Places API.
You will need to create a project in the Google Cloud Platform Console, and
enable the Google Maps API. GCP will give you an API token that you will need
later.  By default, the Geocoding and Places API will not be enabled, so you
need to enable them as well (`Maps API dashboard > APIs > Geocoding API >
Enable`, and `Maps API dashboard > APIs > Places API for Web > Enable`).

* (Linux) Setup permissions

If you are using Linux, you will need to allow the user `www-data` used by the
php docker container to write files to your local disk. You can do this by running
the following commands in the directory containing your local clone of the
repository:

```
sudo chown -R $(id -u):82 coopcycle-web
sudo chmod -R g+w coopcycle-web
```

* Run the install scripts.

```sh
make install
```

### Run the application

* Start the Docker containers
```
docker-compose up
```

* Or if needed with an additional UI to help you manage the containers environment

Use the below command to get the [portainer](https://portainer.io/) UI:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-portainer.yml up
```
open http://localhost:9000 to access portainer
Setup and confirm the admin password the first time you use it.

* Open the platform in your browser
```
open http://localhost
```

Testing
-------

* Create the test database

```
docker-compose run php bin/console doctrine:schema:create --env=test
```

* Launch the PHPUnit tests

```
make phpunit
```

* Launch the Behat tests

```
make behat
```

* Launch the Mocha tests

```
make mocha
```

* Copy or create selenium-side-runner container

Copy or generated with [selenium IDE](https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/).side files in the folder docker/selenium

Update the hidden file .side.env with required capabilities for your tests see official doc: [selenium-side-runner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-side-runner)

Build a selenium-side-runner image:
```
docker build -f Dockerfile-Selenium -t your_selenium-runner_name .
```

* Run GUI selenium-side-runner tests:

First install [Zalenium](https://opensource.zalando.com/zalenium/)
```
# Pull docker-selenium
docker pull elgalu/selenium

# Pull Zalenium
docker pull dosel/zalenium
```
Then run Zalenium with the network option --network="host"

```
docker run --rm -ti --name zalenium --network="host" -p 4444:4444 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp/videos:/home/seluser/videos --privileged dosel/zalenium start
```
Then run your selenium-side-runner container with the same network option --network="host"
```
docker run --network="host" your_selenium-side-runner_name
```

Running migrations
-------

When pulling change from the remote, the database models may have changed. To apply the changes, you will need to run a database migration.

```
make migrations-migrate
```
